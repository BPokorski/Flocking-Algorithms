# Flocking Algorithms

## General Desscription
Example scripts from master thesis project. Analysis of different flocking algorithms <br/>

Project consist of two version of flocking algorithm:
- **Basic** - basic implementation of flocking algorithm (not included in this example)
- **Octree** - spaced-division based optimisation of algorithm

As well as optimisation with frame reduce computing. <br>
Boids can change their movement direction if obstacle appears on their way.

Boids go through path that consist of 5 food.

## Additional Features

There is also user interface implemented in application which consist of:
- **Boid Number Input/Button** which allows user to enter number of boids to spawn
- **Obstacle Number Input/Button** giving user possibilty to spawn number of obstacles that boid should avoid
- **FPS Counter** - which display current number of FPS
- **Timer** - To measure how long boids will go through their path
- **Restart Button** - allowing to restart application
